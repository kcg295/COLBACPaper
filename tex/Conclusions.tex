In this work we motivated the need for horizontal security, defined horizontal
security, and explored the potential implications of horizontal security, with a
focus on how such a concept could change the fields of Cybersecurity and 
privacy. We examined some examples of different horizontal security practices
and technologies currently in use and discussed the primitives that may be
needed to build future horizontal security systems. We also introduced COLBAC,
a collective based  model that allows for democratic participation in access
control decisions. We then discussed potential future work in the area,
providing first steps towards solving problems in the area of horizontal
security.
