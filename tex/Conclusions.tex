In this work we motivate the need for horizontal security, define horizontal
security, and explore the potential implications of horizontal security, with a
focus on how such a concept could change the fields of cybersecurity and 
privacy. We examine some examples of different horizontal security practices and
technologies currently in use and discuss the primitives that may be needed to 
build future horizontal security systems. We then discuss potential future work
in the area, providing first steps towards solving problems in the area of
horizontal security.
