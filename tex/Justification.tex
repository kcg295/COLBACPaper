In this work we challenge the existing hierarchical approaches to access control
and provide an alternative system for horizontal and participatory access
control. We believe that this work fits as a regular submission to NSPW since it
recognizes the limitations of an existing security paradigm and proposes a new
solution that solves the problem of access control in a more fair, horizontal,
and participatory way. To our knowledge there is no other access control system
that attempts this, making this a novel angle to approach access control. Since
access control is a security primitive that other security systems are built on
top of, the introduction of a horizontal method of access control may open up
new possibilities for re-envisioning security tools and techniques.
