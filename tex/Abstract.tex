Social structures around the world are continuing to become more inclusive and
democratic. Governance structures have mostly switched away from old dictatorial
and monarchical structures into structures of citizen participation. Some
business structures are beginning to shift from strictly hierarchical
organization, such as that of the traditional corporation or business, to a more
democratic structure of worker ownership, such as a worker cooperative. Many
activists groups run themselves without hierarchical structure at all, relying
on democratic participation of members to decide which ways they act. Despite
this, Cybersecurity structures lag behind this change, remaining rooted in their
origins in highly hierarchical military structures. In this paper we explore
what it means to design horizontal security. We explore different potential
approaches to horizontal security, and examine some examples of horizontal
security practices currently in use. We introduce a first attempt at a
horizontal access control system, called COLBAC. We then address some potential
benefits and drawbacks of horizontal security, and the effect they may have on
an organization. We then conclude with future work, and how the idea of
horizontal security may be realized in the future.
