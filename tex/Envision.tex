% In order to understand the concept of horizontal security, we must first examine
% the current state of security and its goals. For the purposes of this work, we
% will examine security through the traditional scheme of Confidentiality,
% Integrity and Availability.

% XXX: I'd like to flip "individual' to entity, as it feels that we could be
% talking about bots/platforms/processes and more in this horizontal security
% fashion
% XXX: this also makes me wonder wether we want to bring the cyborg concept in
% a playful way. It is not fundamental to the argument, but in a way we are
% identifying these non-humans as part of the collective.
Central to the issue of Horizontal Security are is the notion of
\emph{authorization} (i.e., who is allowed to access a particular resource). If
an authorized party reads, modifies, or destroys information, the definitions
imply that there is no breach. Thus, whether or not the security of an
organization has been breached depends highly on whether or not an entity is
authorized to perform an action. This decision as to whether or not an entity is
authorized is heavily informed by an organization's security policy.



% Thus, from these definitions we get that confidentiality is the protection of 
% information from unauthorized disclosure, integrity is the protection of
% information from unauthorized modification or destruction, and availability is
% the protection from the disruption of access to or use of information or an
% information system.
%

% Here, I tried to remove the old text relating to policy vs implementation and
% instead I'm trying to highlight the highly hierarchical notion of regular AC
% systems.  As a consequence, I'm leaving this
% policy/enforcement/implementation triad to arise naturally later in the text
However, as is natural with the notion of authorization, two fundamental pieces
must exist: authorization \emph{policies} that represent collective-based
authorization, and an access control system that can \emph{enforce} such
policies.

\subsection{Hierarchy and Access Control}
\label{sec:definition}

Access control is commonly both encoded and enforced in a top-down fashion. The
CISO of an organization holds institutional power to define access control
policies within an organization. Further, without loss of generality,
lower-level administrators may have some decision making power in how to define
subsets of a policy, yet, they typically do not have decision making power to
change the direction of the policy completely. 

This concept typically holds true not just with access control and
authorization, but with all aspects of an organization's security policy.
Decisions about how infringements are dealt with or the scope of the policies
are also made in this manner. Decisions about how these policies are enforced,
and what security mechanisms are used, are also made up top, with entities at
the bottom left to enact the desires passed on to them.

We see, then, that hierarchy introduces itself in multiple dimensions of
security. These dimensions include the different decision-making processes of
security. Instead, it is possible that horizontal security may be achieved by
shifting policy making powers, implementation decisions, and enforcement
powers, and other dimensions of security away from individuals and towards
democratic, participatory processes\footnote{Further questions arise when we
consider the structures of organizations with flexible memberships, who operate
on principles of open participation (plein-air citizens assemblies, etc.), but
these will be explored in future work}.

% FIXME: I'm not entirely sure if this matters a lot for the central point
% we are not trying to measure horizontality here anymore. Instead, we want
% to show how a horizontal system can be managed.
% SOLTUION: I think we just remove it then, right? Measuring is not the goal of
% this paper.
%One important aspect of this concept is the fact horizontality requires
%different dimensions of security -- policy making, implementation, enforcement,
%and more. If one area is highly hierarchical and centralized, it has a profound
%effect on the hierarchy and centralization of the organization as a whole. For
%example: if the implementation of a security policy (through choosing security
%mechanisms, implementing firewall rules, etc.) is heavily centralized and
%hierarchical, then the member(s) of the organization who implement the policies
%can decide how to implement security mechanisms to ensure policies are
%followed, or worse still, whether to implement any security mechanisms at all.
%This centralization leads to an imbalance of power similar to the one discussed
%by Kavada regarding activism and social media~\cite{kavada2020counterpublics}.

% Fixme: this brings up the question of *identity*. Entities are multi-phrenic,
% how can we reconcile access to resources when everybody can wear many hats
% within the organization. Signed: the chair of shitposting society at 
% HorizontalSecurityPaper enterprises. I'm actually a little bit more interested
% in hearing about this than the binary-ness of this (and I think they are
% deeply connected)
% FIXME: I struggled with this part. Please reread it and see if anything is
% worth salvaging. After reading it many times I think it's terrible. If you
% think you can save the idea, awesome, but my recomendation would be to just
% take this paragraph out.
% NEW (KG):
%When shifting to these participatory processes, identity still remains a central
%question in access control decisions. When determining whether or not to grant
%access, the collective will consider which entity or entites they wish to grant
%access to, taking into account many attributes included competency, trust, and
%current power dyanmics within the collective. Thus, though other access control
%schemes like capabilities can create identity-agnostic protocols, collective
%based access control systems require this information to be present.
% DELETED:
%Another implication of the fact that the horizontality of security is
%multi-dimensional is that horizontality is not a binary trait, but rather a
%spectrum between entirely dictatorial and fully horizontal. In practice, most
%organizations likely do not sit at either extreme of this spectrum, or even
%occupy a fixed space on this spectrum. Rather, organizations are likely to have
%dynamic levels of horizontality. In traditional, hierarchical organizations,
%security is likely more skewed towards a lower amount of horizontality, and is
%likely to not be too dynamic. Decisions are made by managers, who may or may not
%consider the input of their employees when making decisions. In worker
%cooperatives,  activist groups, and other traditionally less hierarchical
%organizations, security is more likely skewed towards a higher amount of
%horizontality, and may be much more dynamic in nature. An interesting first work
%towards understanding horizontal security may exist in classifying, comparing,
%and contrasting the current horizontality of security in different types of
%organizations. This idea, and other potential future works, are further examined
%in Section~\ref{sec:futurework}.

% TODO: Include here the lack of ability to be horizontal when hierarchical
% tools are used, and vice-versa, the lack of ability to be hierarchical when
% horizontal tools are used. Can we develop technology that allows us to do
% both when they are needed?
However, organizations that attempt to create their access control policies
horizontally may run into problems when they move to implement them. Currently,
access control systems force the creation of a hierarchy. In access control
systems such as MAC, DAC, or RBAC, certain entities in the organization have the
power to implement the access control rules that were democratically created by
the organization. Thus, if the individuals who have the ability to enforce the
rules decide not to, the newly created access control policies become
ineffective. This forms a hierarchy with the entities capable of enforcing
access control sitting at the top. Similarly, if an organization were to attempt
to temporarily act hierarchically and attempted to implement that using tools
that assumed horizontality, this may cause the hierarchy to lose any potential
efficiency benefits. Thus, a question arises: can we develop technology that
allows an organization to be flexible and dynamic in its horizontality, being
participatory or hierarchical depending on the needs at hand, without
jeopardizing the ability to return to horizontality when desired?

\subsection{Horizontality, Tools, and Techniques}
Having explored the principles that unlock horizontality, we can move on to
creating specific systems that allow entities to organize in such a way.

% XXX: I removed this paragraph below because it was repetitive imvho.
% In Section~\ref{sec:definition} we discussed horizontality of security as being
% multidimensional and dynamic, and relating to the different decision making
% processes that an organization has around security. Thus, we see that
% horizontality is related to security policy decisions, as the participation in
% these decision making processes informs what power individuals in the
% organization have to say how they wish to secure their operations.

% FIXME: ok, I get it, we've been hammering on the verticality of organizations
% and their tools, do we need more?
However, this does not mean that the influence of hierarchy does not affect the
tools and techniques used in Cybersecurity, and that some tools and techniques
do not imply or impose hierarchy. For example, most operating systems
tend to be built around the idea of the singular administrator or a small set of
administrators setting up the system. This idea makes sense from a  hierarchical
organization's perspective. After all, if the individuals higher in the
hierarchy have more privileges, that simply reflects their decision-making 
power within the organization. From a horizontal security perspective, however,
this method of system administration is detrimental. If a singular administrator
decides that they do not like the policy decisions of the organization, they may
be able to use their administrative power to stop the organization from taking
the democratically selected action. When this occurs, there may not be another
individual with more privileges to override this decision. Thus, the very
concept of an administrator with the power to shut out other administrators is a
threat to a horizontally controlled organization.

On the other hand, there do exist systems that were designed with a more
horizontal structure in mind. One example of this is the Bitcoin 
cryptocurrency~\cite{nakamoto2019bitcoin}. This cryptocurrency was developed to
allow for financial transactions between two individuals without the need for a
trusted third party to detect and prevent double spending. By design, the
network prevents the modification of past blocks of the Blockchain unless there
exists collusion of 51\% of the miner network. This decision was made
specifically to make it difficult for malicious actors in the network to perform
malicious activities, such as stealing bitcoin or deleting past transactions.
The implication of this design is that Bitcoin cannot be centrally 
regulated~\cite{tu2015rethinking}, at least in theory . If we re-frame the
concept of collusion as cooperation via democratic vote, we see that this design
allows for regulation of the Bitcoin network in a somewhat horizontal way. Thus,
if a transaction was deemed to be against a security policy by the majority of
the network, it is possible to remove it.

Though this is more horizontal policy enforcement than other tools promote, it
still has many issues. The first issue is that of defining the stakeholders of
Bitcoin: are only miners stakeholders, or are users stakeholders as well? If we
define the stakeholders are only the miners of Bitcoin, we see that this
approach reaches a reasonable level of horizontality. All miners participate in
the decision to perform a modification on the Blockchain, whether they vote yes
or no. If we consider users to also be stakeholders, however, we see that this
system is no longer as horizontal. Users do not get to participate in the
decision of whether or not a transaction gets removed or modified. 

Another issue with this approach is its competitive nature. Rather than
cooperating miners attempting to create, implement, and enforce transaction
policies, we have competing miners interested in their own profit. One
implication of this competitive focus is that there is no mechanism to vote in
Bitcoin; rather, what is referred to as ``regulation'' in this work is seen by
the Bitcoin community as an attack. However, the design property of requiring
51\% of participating members to agree in order to make a change on the system
may still be useful to inspire future horizontal system designs. Worse still,
this competitive nature tends to centralize the network over time. Bitcoin's
Proof of Work algorithm tends to favor those who can afford highly specialized
hardware, eventually leading to a centralization of the network into the hands
of those who are wealthy enough to control large amounts of machines
specifically made for mining Bitcoins. Proof of Stake, another consensus
algorithm for Blockchain, bypasses this middle step and directly benefits those
who control larger amounts of monetary stake in the network.

% TODO: Add something about the DOA hack.

Despite these issues, the security design of Blockchain is still more horizontal
than typical designs. However, Blockchain is not the only security technology
with a less hierarchical vision and structure. Perhaps the most well known
example of a security system meant to be horizontal by design is the PGP Web of
Trust design. This design was created to solve the key distribution problem
without the need for a centralized, trusted key distribution authority. It
allows individuals to make trust decisions about the ownership of a key based on
validating the key ownership in person or over a trusted secure channel. Once a
key is validated, the keys that are signed by that individual's keys are also
trusted, though to a lesser extent. This design was meant to be a horizontal
representation of trust: one trusts the people they verify in person, and then
trusts the people attested to by their trusted peers, but to a lesser degree.
However, this scheme suffered from a large number of usability and user
experience problems~\cite{whitten1999johnny}. However, if a method like web of
trust or derived from web of trust could be improved to be more usable, it could
serve as a building block for applications and systems that take a horizontal
approach to security.

In addition to the Blockchain approach used by Bitcoin, and to the web of trust
used by PGP, many other potential building blocks of horizontal security already
exist. These include other consensus algorithms such as Practical Byzantine
Fault Tolerance (PBFT)~\cite{castro1999practical}, Paxos~\cite{lamport2019part}, 
Raft~\cite{ongaro2013search}, and more. In addition to consensus algorithms,
secret sharing schemes like Shamir Secret Sharing~\cite{shamir1979share}, 
Blakley's Secret Sharing~\cite{blakley1993linear}, and Verifiable Secret 
Sharing~\cite{chor1985verifiable} schemes can be used for distributed secret
management in organizations. Applications like OAuth~\cite{leiba2012oauth} can
be used to grant minimal and ephemeral access to organization accounts to
members of the organization who need it, without revealing a password. 
Capability~\cite{dennis1966programming} based schemes and systems can be used to
allow for transfer of control over resources based on the will of the
collective. Additionally, other yet undeveloped primitives, techniques, and
tools may be needed as well. Future work can address these needs, as described
in Section~\ref{sec:futurework}.

%Conclusion: Security is purely horizontal when the policies and enforcement are
%handled via direct democratic vote. Horizontality is a spectrum, ranging from
%hierarchical (one person with decision making power) to purely horizontal.
%Examples of spots on the spectrum include:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item direct democracy / consensus cooperatives
%\item Random review (i.e. code review)
%\item random/elected representatives w/ early revocation
%\item random/elected representatives w/o early revocation
%\item appointed representatives
%\item hierarchical
%\end{itemize}

%Very few spots on this spectrum are represented in current techniques and
%techologies. Mostly the hierarchical approach is developed because of its
%continued use in business and government. As that changes, cybesecurity needs to
%be ahead of the curve and create technologies for the organizations and
%businesses that sit on the other portions of this spectrum.
